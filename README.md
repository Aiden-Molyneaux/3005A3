To demonstrate Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a postgres database, I have developed a small client/server JavaScript program with a RESTful API. I utilized vanilla JS for the front-end, Node for the back-end, and webpack for bundling.

### How to setup and run
1. Ensure that your local 'students' database table is built
2. Clone this repository to your local machine, then navigate into the 3005A3 directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. In server.js, change the postgres database credentials to match your own (user, host, database, password, port)
5. In one terminal run `node server.js` to run the Express server
6. In another terminal run `npm start` to run webpack. This should automatically open a browser tab with the application
