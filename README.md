COMP3005, assignment 3, question 1

How to setup and run:
1. Ensure that your local 'students' database table is built
2. Clone this repository to your local machine, then navigate into the 3005A3 directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. In server.js, change the postgres database credentials to match your own (user, host, database, password, port)
5. In one terminal run `node server.js` to run the Express server
6. In another terminal run `npm start` to run webpack. This should automatically open a browser tab with the application
